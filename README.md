# 🖼️ Image Processing Assignments – PPU 2025

This repository contains four assignments completed for the **Image Processing** course at **Palestine Polytechnic University** in 2025, taught by **Dr. Zein Salah**. Each task focuses on implementing key image processing techniques using **Python** and **OpenCV**.

## 📂 Assignments Overview

### 1. Image Thresholding
This program reads a grayscale or color image (converted to grayscale) and applies dual thresholding. Pixels with intensity values between two user-defined thresholds (0–255) are retained; all others are set to black.

### 2. Edge Detection with Sobel Operator
Implements the Sobel operator to detect edges in grayscale images. The process includes convolution with Sobel kernels, optional image smoothing, and thresholding to produce a binary edge map.

### 3. Green Football Field Detection
Detects green regions in football field images using color segmentation, inspired by RoboCup techniques. The output is the original image overlaid with a red mask highlighting the green areas.

### 4. Coin Segmentation and Text Removal
Segments coins from images containing added text or noise. Combines grayscale conversion, thresholding, and morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, and closing) to clean the image. The final result isolates coins and removes unwanted text or background.
